# AWS_Visualize_data_with_QuickSight

Here's how I used Amazon QuickSight to visualise Netflix's catalogue trends 📊


🔍 Throughout this AWS project, I learned how to:

✅ Upload and store datasets in Amazon S3.

✅ Connect datasets to Amazon QuickSight for analysis.

✅ Create visualisations like donut charts, bar graphs, and tables.

✅ Answer complex data questions using QuickSight's functionalities.



🌟 The highlight of the project was putting all of these visualisations into one big dashboard - so satisfying to see them work together.



💼 This hands-on experience not only enhanced my AWS skills but also sharpened my data visualisation and analysis capabilities, essential in today's data-driven world.
